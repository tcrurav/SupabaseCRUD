# Simplest CRUD example with React and Supabase

This project is just a project example to learn how to use Supabase with React.

## Getting Started

Read the links in the acknowlegements section bellow to get an idea about Supabase.

The final result looks like this, i.e. a simple CRUD without update.

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

First follow the following 3 steps to create your Supabase project and add the database to it:

* Step 1: Create an account in Supabase.

* Step 2: Create a Supabase project.

* Step 3: Inside your project go to the SQL Editor and create your ```bicycles``` table. After that clic on the green bottom ```Run```.

Here you have the code to copy/paste in the SQL Editor:

````
 -- Create the table
 CREATE TABLE bicycles (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   brand VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   model VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
 );
 -- Insert some sample data into the table
 INSERT INTO bicycles (brand,model) VALUES ('BH','Star');
 INSERT INTO bicycles (brand,model) VALUES ('Orbea','Sky');
 ````

After that clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/SupabaseCRUD.git
```

Now install all dependencies.

```
cd SupabaseCRUD
npm install
```

You must look for the correct project ref and the supabase anon key of your supabase project.

Now create the .env file. You can copy from the example file .env.example. And put the correct project-ref and supabase anon key. 

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=<supabase-key>
```

And finally run the project.

```
cd SupabaseCRUD
npm start
```

Enjoy!!!
